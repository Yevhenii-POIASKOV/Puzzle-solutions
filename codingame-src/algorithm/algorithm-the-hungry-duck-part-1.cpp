====
Goal
====
You are a duck sitting in the top left field of a WÃ—H-sized lake.
In every field of the lake is a different amount of food.
Your duck is only allowed to move to the right or down.
What is the maximum amount of food you can eat before reaching the bottom right field?

In part 1 you only swim in small lakes where you don't have to care about timeouts.

=====
Input
=====
Line 1: Two space separated integers W and H for the width and height of the room
Next H lines: W integers for the amount of food
Output
Line 1: The maximum amount of food you are able to eat.
