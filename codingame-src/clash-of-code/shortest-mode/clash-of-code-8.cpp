The Goal
========
Bj√∂rn owns a small company with 6 employees. He has decided to give a gift for the most secure password in the company, given the following rules:

A passwords s is valid only if:
- its length is 8 <= s <= 15
- it contains at least one number
- it contains at least one upper-case character
- it doesn't contain any space

He attributes points to a password as follows and sums up the points:

- each space character gives 0 point
- each upper-case character gives 10 points
- each lower-case character gives 5 points
- each digit gives only 1 point
- every other character (like "!.,&-@) gives 25 points.

=====
Input
=====
Line 1: The password strings, which contains only ASCII characters.

======
Output
======
A string valid, points based on the given password, where

- valid is "True" Or "False"
- points is an integer that represents the sum of the points of each character in the password
