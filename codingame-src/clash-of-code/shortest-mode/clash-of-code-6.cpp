The Goal
========
CodinGame.com is an online platform for programmers to improve their coding skills through game-based challenges and puzzles.

The site has a "leveling" system - by doing various activities you gain XP and once you get enough XP you get promoted to the next level. Specifically, to get from level L - 1 to level L you need (rounded down) (L^1.5)* 10 XP

For example, to go from level 2 to level 3 you need 
3^1.5*10 = 51.96152423 â‰ˆ 51 additional XP.

Your task is to implement the algorithm that determines how much more XP a player needs to level up.    

=====
Input
=====
Line 1: An integer level for the level the user is currently on.
Line 2: An integer xp for the amount of XP the user has collected since reaching level

======
Output
======
The amount of XP the user has to gain to reach the next level (as an integer), or "LEVEL UP" if the user already has enough XP to level up.
